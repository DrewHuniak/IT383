pipe() - The pipe api call is a way for communication of data between two related processes. This is a common way to send data between both the parent and the child processes. It works by having an int pointer used to determine whether you are reading or writing to the pipe. If successful it will return 0 and if it failed it returns -1.
write() - The write() call is a low level api call that makes use of the write system call. It takes a file descriptor, message, and message length as its parameters. It returns how many bytes were written if sucessfull, if the value is negative than there was an error.
close() - The close() function deallocates the file descriptor previously used in the write() api call. If the call was sucessfull it returns 0, and if it failed it returns -1.
